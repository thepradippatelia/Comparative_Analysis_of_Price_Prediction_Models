# Comparative Analysis of Price Prediction Models for Cotton: A Statistical and Machine Learning Approach

In this project, we focus on cotton price prediction, a vital element in India's agricultural landscape. Leveraging time series data and various models including ARIMA, ARIMAX, ARCH, ARCHX, VAR, and LSTM, we offer accurate insights into future cotton prices. This work aids stakeholders throughout the cotton supply chain, from farmers to policymakers, in making informed decisions and strategic planning for the dynamic cotton commodity market.


## Dataset


The time series data of daily prices of cotton from the [AGMARKNET](https://agmarknet.gov.in/) website for 13 years (from January 2010 to October 2023) has been collected for the Rajkot market of Gujarat and Ranebennur of Karnataka to predict the prices.
